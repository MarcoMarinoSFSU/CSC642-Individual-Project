CSC 642 842 Fall 2021 Individual Assignment Marco Marino

Here is the link to test my individual assignment URL https://matronly-persons.000webhostapp.com/index.html

For the development of my project, I used a bootstrap framework along with html, css, and php. In addition, I used 000webhost.com to host my website.

For field validation I used regex and html form validation such as the 'required' tag.

For maps I used google maps with a custom api key to ensure the map works properly.

For captcha I used the google reCaptcha v2 invisible check.

I was not assisted by any other students for this assignment.

Documentation and Code I developed for this assignment are in github https://github.com/MarcoMarinoSFSU/CSC642-Individual-Project

Regards,
Marco Marino
